                I have been programming in C# for video game development over the past four years. I learned all of my
                code from online tutorials: Unity and Youtube. Starting this year, I began practicing 3D, lowpoly art to
                round myself out as a game developer. Now I want to expand my knowledge as a programmer past front end
                game development. In my free time, I play video games and Dungeons & Dragons with my friends.

                As for work, I started cooking in my junior year of high school. I had never cooked at home, so I had
                nearly zero experience cooking. I applied to a gourmet resturant, and the only question they asked me in
                my interview was : "When can you start?" Turns out they were just desperate for a cook. Now I have been
                cooking for three years, and I currently work at Snooze: a tasteful, fun, and fast paced resturant.
